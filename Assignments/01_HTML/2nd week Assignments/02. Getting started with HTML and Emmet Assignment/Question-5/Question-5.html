    <h2>What is emmet?</h2>
    <p>Emmet is a plugin for text editors that allows for faster and more efficient HTML and CSS coding. It allows
        developers to write HTML and CSS code using shorthand notation, which is then expanded into full code by the
        plugin</p>
    <h2>Some advantages of emmet?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Grouping elements</li>
        <p>Emmet allows for the grouping of elements using parentheses. This can be useful for creating complex
            structures or for applying styles to multiple elements at once. For example, (div>p)*3 will create three
            groups of a div element containing a p element.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Multi-caret editing</li>
        <p>Emmet allows for multi-caret editing, which allows a developer to make the same change in multiple places at
            once. This can be useful for making global changes or for editing complex nested structures.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Zen coding</li>
        <p>Emmet includes a feature called Zen coding, which allows for even more efficient and powerful shorthand
            notation. This can be used for things like creating complex nested structures, applying multiple classes and
            IDs, and more.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Snippets</li>
        <p> Emmet includes a variety of built-in snippets that can be used to quickly generate common code patterns.
            This can include things like creating a basic HTML template, creating a list with a specific number of
            items, and more.</p>
    </ul>
