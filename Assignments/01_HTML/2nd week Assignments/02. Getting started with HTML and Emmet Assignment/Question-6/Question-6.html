    <h1>Comments</h1>
    <P style="text-align: justify;">Adding comments in HTML can help you write and organize the backend of your webpage. They’re so useful that it’s considered a best practice to use them.You can add comments to explain your code, which will make it easier to edit in the future or to work with other developers. You can also use comments to simplify your debugging efforts by “commenting out” lines of code without deleting them. In this post, we’ll look more closely at what a comment is in HTML, as well asWith the comments tag, you can leave notes to remind yourself where you left off in the build process. You could explain the intended functionality of a section of code for another developer or your future self. Or, you might assign someone a task or point out an error for them with a comment.</P>

    <h4>How to Write a Comment In HTML</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To leave a comment in HTML, place a <b><"!-- tag before the code and a --"></b> tag after the code that you want to hide. These tags tell browsers to ignore anything between them. For example, say you’re building a website with a team of developers. You want to leave a note reminding them that all buttons should use the same color. You can also quickly comment a line of code with the keyboard shortcut <b>Ctrl + / on PC or Command + /</b>. This method is much faster than typing the tags manually.</p>
