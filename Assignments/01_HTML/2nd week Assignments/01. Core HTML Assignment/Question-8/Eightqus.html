    <h2>Full stack web development tech stack.</h2>
    <dl>
        <b> Frontend tech stack</b>
        <dd>For most of the web applications, the choice of frontend remains similar. Modern web applications are based
            on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, or frameworks based on JS, like React, Vue, and Express. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <b> HTML</b>
        <dd>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) defines the basic layout and structure of your pages. For example, the
            sections, bulleted points, and tables are created using HTML tags. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <b> CSS</b>
        <dd>All the styling that’s applied to the web pages comes from CSS—for example, the green theme of the MongoDB
            pages. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <b>JavaScript</b>
        <dd>The dynamic elements of the page come from the JavaScript code written by developers. For example, what
            happens when you hover your mouse over an image, or when you click on a submit, like, or comment button is
            decided by JavaScript events in the code.

            There are many other frameworks and libraries—like Bootstrap, Vue, React, Angular, and jQuery—that are built
            on JavaScript and provide additional functionalities and common use cases, making a developer’s life much
            easier. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <b>Backend tech stack</b>
        <dd>The backend or server-side tech stack consists of many components, like database, server, framework, and
            operating system. You have to choose the server-side frameworks and tools carefully, because some
            technologies are lightweight, fast, and suitable for basic purposes, whereas some are loaded with features
            that only a complex application might need.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <b>User Interface</b>
        <dd>You can use markup like HTML and CSS stylesheets, or frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind, depending on the
            styling needs of the project.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl><b>Programming language</b>
        <dd>Programming languages take care of the important business logic that your applications need. Some top
            programming languages are JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Ruby, Scala, PHP, and C#.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl><b>framework</b>
        <dd> Frameworks provide a structure to the application and have common utilities so that you don’t have to write
            every piece of logic from scratch. Some popular web frameworks are Express, Spring, Django, Laravel, Rails,
            and .NET.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl><b>Runtime enviroment</b>
        <dd>Runtime environment is the software in which an application is run. Runtime provides cross-platform
            compatibility. Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Node.js, and Common Language Runtime (CLR) are examples of
            runtime environments.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl><b>Servers</b>
        <dd>A web server takes in requests (http) from the client (example, browser), passes it on to the database for
            the requested information, and handles the response. Apache httpd and Nginx are commonly used robust web
            servers.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl><b>Databases</b>
        <dd>Databases are an integral part of a tech stack. Whether your application is simple or has many workflows,
            you need a place to store all your information. Some popular databases are MongoDB and MySQL. Modern data
            platforms like MongoDB further enhance the functionality of a database by providing intelligent querying,
            aggregation, and transformation features, in addition to data storage and retrieval.

            There are many other components—like APIs, analytics tools, BI tools, cloud services, and microservices—that
            can enhance the functions of an application.</dd>
