    <h1>what is accessibility.</h1>
    <p>Accessibility in web development means enabling as many people as possible to use websites, even when those
        people's abilities are limited in some way."The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever
        their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to
        people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability."</p>
