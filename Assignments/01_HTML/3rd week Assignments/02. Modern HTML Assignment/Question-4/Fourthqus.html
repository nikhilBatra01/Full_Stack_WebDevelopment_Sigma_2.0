    <h1>List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML.   </h1> <hr />
    <p>Improving the accessibility of HTML is crucial for ensuring that web content can be accessed and understood by individuals with disabilities. Here are three ways to enhance HTML accessibility:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Semantic HTML => </li><p>Using semantic HTML elements appropriately is essential for accessibility. Semantic elements such as "header", "nav", "main", "section", "article", "aside", and "footer" provide meaning and structure to the content. By using these elements correctly, you make it easier for screen readers and assistive technologies to understand the page structure, improving accessibility for visually impaired users.</p>
        <li>Providing Alternative Text (Alt Text) for Images => </li><p>Images play a significant role in web content, but they may not be accessible to visually impaired individuals. By adding alternative text (alt text) to images using the alt attribute, you can provide a textual description of the image. Screen readers can then read out the alt text to users who cannot see the image, ensuring they understand the content. It is important to write descriptive alt text that conveys the purpose and meaning of the image accurately.</p>
        <li>Keyboard accessibility => </li><p>Not all users can interact with a webpage using a mouse or touch screen. Some individuals rely on keyboards or other alternative input devices to navigate and interact with content. Ensuring that your HTML is keyboard accessible is vital for these users. You can achieve keyboard accessibility by using proper HTML structure, providing keyboard focus indicators, and making interactive elements, such as buttons and links, accessible via the keyboard. Testing your website's keyboard accessibility and making any necessary improvements will enhance the overall accessibility of your HTML.</p>
