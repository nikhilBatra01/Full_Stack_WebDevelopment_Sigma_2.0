    <h1>TAGS.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">The opening tag</li>
        <p>This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets.
            This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">The closing tag</li>
        <p>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This
            states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one
            of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">The content</li>
        <p> This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</p>

    </ul>

    <h1>ELEMENTS. </h1>

    <ul>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">HTML Elements </li>
        <P>Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root
            element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.</P>

        <li style="font-weight: bold;">META Elements </li>
        <p>Represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML
            meta-related elements, like
            base,
            link,
            Script, style and title.</p>

        <li style="font-weight: bold;">TITLE Elements</li>
        <p>Defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text;
            tags within the element are ignored.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;"> HEAD Elements</li>
        <p>Contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title, scripts, and style
            sheets.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">BODY Elements</li>
        <p> the body element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your
            page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</p>
    </ul>

                sets the currentcolor value. currentcolor may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is
                the default for other color properties, such as border-color.</td>

                of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the height of
                the border area.</td>
