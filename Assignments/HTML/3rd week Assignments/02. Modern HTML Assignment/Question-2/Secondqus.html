    <h1>What are HTML entites.</h1>
    <p>An <a target="_blank" style="color: blue;" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML">HTML</a>
        entity is a piece of text ("string") that begins with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;). Entities
        are frequently used to display reserved characters (which would otherwise be interpreted as HTML code), and
        invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces). You can also use them in place of other characters that are
        difficult to type with a standard keyboard.</p>
